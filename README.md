# Tic-Tac-Toe in C

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C. The game features a 3x3 board where two players (Player 1 and Player 2) take turns marking spots with "X" or "O". The game automatically checks for a winner after each move and displays the result (winner or tie). After the game ends, players are given the option to play again.
